## Practice OOP Vocabulary Challenge
# 1) I want you to create a class called Treehouse. 
# 2) Add a class attribute called product that is equal to the 
#### string “coding courses”
# 3) Add an initializer method that takes a parameter called name.
# 4) Add a name instance attribute set equal to the parameter being passed in. 
# 5) Create a method called learn. Inside the method return a string that
#### contains the name instance attribute so you would get something 
#### like “Tim is learning to code!” where Tim is the name passed into 
#### the class. 
# 6) Create an instance of the class and save it to a variable 
#### named my_treehouse. Pass in your name as the name parameter. 
# 7) (And final step) call your learn method and print out the result. 


class Treehouse:
    product = "coding courses"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def learn(self):
        return f"{self.name} is learning to code!"


my_treehouse = Treehouse("Megan")
print(my_treehouse.learn())
